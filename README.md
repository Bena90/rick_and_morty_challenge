## What will I find?
In this challenge I tried to touch as many issues as I could and prioritize performance and server-side rendering. My original idea was to use clean architecture but then I saw it oversized for the size of this project so I limited myself to just modeling classes to model the API responses.

- Server side rendering
- Client side rendering
- SOLID principles
- HOC components pattern
- Compound components pattern
